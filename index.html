 <h3>
      Who Am I?
  </h3>
  <p>
Born and raised in the Bay Area, California, I grew up around diverse cultures, languages, and faces. I am a product of a loving and resilient immigrant community that has also been impacted by institutionalized injustice and systemic barriers. My community experienced housing segregation and underserved education systems. Everyday I saw  hardworking and resilient immigrant families work blue collar jobs and navigate convoluted Western systems. My family and the larger community that raised me became my source of strength and drive to attain higher education and help dismantle systems of oppression.

  <h3>
My Values & Mission
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am passionate about combating mental healthcare disparities through meaningful community-driven research. My mission includes identifying need, leveraging evidence-based approaches, and developing solutions to address inequity and promote quality of life for marginalized populations.
