  <h3>
Who Am I?
</h3>
  <p>
Born and raised in the Canal Area of San Rafael, California, I grew up around diverse cultures, languages, and faces. I am a product of a loving immigrant community impacted by systemic barriers. My community experienced housing segregation, underserved education systems, and minimal employment opportunities. Everyday I saw my hardworking and resilient immigrant families work blue collar jobs and navigate convoluted Western systems. My family and the larger community became my source of strength and drive.

  <h3>
My Values & Mission
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am passionate about combating mental healthcare disparities through meaningful community-driven research and sustainable interventions. My mission includes understanding mechanisms of the health systems and developing solutions to address contributing factors related to inequity and compromised quality of life for marginalized populations.
